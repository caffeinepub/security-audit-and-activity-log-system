  "summary": "REQ-65 appears implemented in AccessDeniedScreen with explicit \"Web control\" unsupported messaging and guidance to request Security/ICP Controller access while preserving Principal ID copy. REQ-64 cannot be confirmed from the provided diff excerpts; the Roles & Access panel changes shown do not include the required \"Web control\" copy, and the file summary does not mention it. Additionally, AccessDeniedScreen includes embedded ICP panels not requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The diff excerpt for RolesAccessPanel.tsx does not show any of the required \"Web control\" / \"World Wide Web Controller\" guidance text, and the frontend file summary for RolesAccessPanel is truncated without mentioning the new copy.
