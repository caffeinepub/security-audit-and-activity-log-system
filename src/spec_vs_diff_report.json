  "summary": "Diff adds a Web Control Quick Tools panel, introduces a shared audit execution wrapper for Web Control terminal commands, and begins a data-driven command catalog used by the World Wide Web Controller command registry (with enhanced help output). Diff summary also indicates unrelated additions around World Wide Web Controller role management hooks/panels that were not requested.",

      "id": "REQ-81",
      "requirement": "Ensure every Web Control terminal command (existing and newly added) attempts best-effort audit recording using the existing helper pattern and never fails solely because audit logging is unavailable.",
      "reason": "While a shared wrapper (executeWithAudit/executeLocalCommand) was added and is used by at least some commands (e.g., help/clear and web-controller-status), the diff is truncated and does not show that all existing and newly generated Web Control commands are consistently wrapped to attempt audit recording.",

      "reason": "A data-driven catalog file and help grouping/count output were added, but the diff is truncated before showing the full catalog generation and the final registry size; it is not directly evidenced that 200+ distinct commands are actually produced and registered.",
